part 1
no they both dont have the same outut as one gets into a infinite loop and the other does not
the first program will keep on adding 2*i to the list and the second program will add 2*i to the list only once beacuse the index is not being updated

part3
2nd and 4th part produce the saem output as [1:3] targets the last 3 elements starting from the left side and [-1:-3] targets the first 3 element from the right side which are eventually the same elements
part4
Unnecessary Check for k in lst:

The line if k not in lst: is unnecessary and incorrect for the purpose of rotating the list. The value of k is meant to represent the number of positions to rotate the list, not an element in the list. This check should be removed.
Incorrect Modulo Operation:

The line k = k % (len(lst) - 1) is incorrect. The correct modulo operation should be k = k % len(lst) to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list. This ensures that the rotation wraps around correctly. Consider the following function:

part5
(A)[[[[[[]]]]]]
(B)()
(c)Yes, the output structure is going to be the same for any value k might take, provided k > 0. The depth of the nested lists or tuples depends on the value of k.

It is not redundant at all, for it serves as the base case of the recursion. Without it, recursion would continue indefinitely until a stack overflow error. It ensures that recursion terminates when k is 0 or negative.

part6
